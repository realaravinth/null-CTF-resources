The entropy(randomness) lies is how their\n  contents(0s and 1s) are arranged. This fingerprint is often calculated using\n  hash functions, such as SHA256.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The flag for this challenge is the SHA256 checksum(fingerprint) of this\n  <a href=\"/file.txt\" target=\"_blank\"> file</a> calculated using SHA256 hash function.\n</p> ";
